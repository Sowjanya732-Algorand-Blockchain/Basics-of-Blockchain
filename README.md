Blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology that ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof data management.

This repository dives into the foundational concepts of blockchain technology, providing practical implementations of hashing, Merkle trees, digital signatures, and a simple blockchain problem. 

It's a great starting point for anyone looking to understand the building blocks of blockchain systems.

Hashing Programs:
  - Compute hashes.
  - Find nonces for blocks with specific constraints.
    
Merkle Tree:
  - Build and validate Merkle trees for efficient data integrity verification.
    
Digital Signatures:
  - Generate key pairs, sign messages, and verify signatures.
    
Blockchain Problem:
  - Solve a blockchain-related problem to understand data immutability and security.
